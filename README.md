# Handler Functions Excercise

This program accepts commands and values, calls *handler functions* and prints returned results.

## Usage

This program is used by providing a valid command and one or more arguments.

Run the command `py convert.py` with no arguments to see the usage syntax and valid commands:

```
convert.py <command> <value1> [value2 ... valueN]

Where commands are:
    c_to_f        Convert Celsius number to Fahrenheit
    f_to_c        Convert Fahrenheit number to Celsius
    USD_to_THB    Convert US Dollar (USD) amount to Thai Baht (THB)
    THB_to_USD    Convert Thai Baht (THB) amount to US Dollar (USD)
```

## Test Handler Function

You will need to implement the above commands and their corresponding handler functions. A handler function is a function that processes the arguments for a particular command and returns the results.

The `convert.py` file contains starter code for a command called `test` and a handler function named `test_func`. This is an example to help you get started, but this example code should be removed and replaced with the actual handler functions for the valid commands.
